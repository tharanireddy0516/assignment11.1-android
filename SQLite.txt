Q1. What is the use of SQLite open helper class in SQLite?

Ans.SQLiteOpenHelper class provides the functionality to use the SQLite database.
    SQLite is an open source relational database which is used to perform database operations on android devices and stores structred data in private database
    SQLiteOpenHelper class is used for database creation and version management. 
    onCreate() and onUpgrade() methods of SQLiteOpenHelper class are used to implement database operations.
    For maximum control over local data, we use SQLite directly by leveraging SQLiteOpenHelper for executing SQL requests and managing a local database
    Every SQLite operation is Atomic,Consistent,Isolated and Durable.
    This class actually takes care of opening the database if it exits,creating it if it does not exist
    and also upgrading it as necessary

Q2. What is the use of OnUpgrade function in SQLiteOpenHelper class?

Ans.onUpgrade is basically for handling new database changes for any new version of your application.
    onUpgrade method is called when the database is upgraded that is modifying the table structure,adding constraints to the database.
    onUpgrade() is only called when the database file exists but the stored version number is lower than requested in constructor.
    The onUpgrade() should update the table schema to the requested version.
    If we want to perform some modification in our database then OnUpgrade method use is come in context.
    context:Context allows access to application-specific resources and classes, as well as calls for application-level operations such as launching activities, broadcasting and receiving intents.

Q3. How to show SQLite database table information in Android application what is the best way to do it?

Ans. The best way to show SQLite database table information in android application is by using table layout with cursor.
     Showing database information will be better suited with table layout. Since table layout is not an adapter view , you can't 
     use cursor adapter with it. So use table layout with cursor to show database table information .
     We can show the table information in Android application by using a listView or RecyclearView
